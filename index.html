<ul>
  <li>The first team to have 21 points exactly at the end of a round wins.</li>
  <li>If a team goes over 21 points at the end of a round, they go back to their original score at the beginning of the round, minus however many points they went over. (For example, if a team started at 19 and got 3 points, they would go down to 18 in the next round.)</li>
  <li>Bags on the board are worth 1 point.</li>
  <li>Bags in the hole are worth 3 points.</li>
  <li>Bags that bounce off the ground onto the board or in the hole are worth 0 points, and must be cleared before the next person throws.</li>
  <li>Teams only add points equal to the number more they earned than the other team. (For example, if Team A earned 5 points and Team B earned 3 points, Team A would add 2 points to their score. Team B would get 0 points that round.)</li>
  <li>Each round consists of 4 bags thrown by one person from each team. The person throwing on each team switches every round.</li>
